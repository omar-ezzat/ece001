				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>The kernel is the core component of an operating computer system. The kernel's main task is to control the communication between the software and the hardware. A Kernel is at a computer's core. It enables the link between the software and the hardware. Although the Kernel is the heart of an operating system, the outermost is a shell. Kernel uses space to control all of a system's functionality such as process management, memory management, computer management, I / O management, and the user using user space to execute software or write a software.</p>
					<h4>Types of kernel</h4>
					<ol start="1" class="ml-5 w-75">
						<li><h5>Monolithic</h5>
							A monolithic kernel is a single software file, or block. It provides all the essential services the operating system offers. It is a simple design that establishes a distinct layer of communication between the software and the hardware.
						</li>
						<li><h5>Microkernels</h5>
							All device resources are handled by microkernel. Services are implemented in different address spaces within this sort of kernel. User services are stored in user address space and kernel services are stored in the address space of the kernel. So, it helps popular both kernel size and operating system.
