                <div class="col-md-8"><p>An Operating system (OS) is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. The most important program running on a computer is operating system (OS). To run other programs each computer must have at least one OS. An application such as Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc. needs some environment where it runs and performs its tasks. The OS assists you in interacting with the computer without understanding how to speak the language of the computer. Computer operating systems perform basic tasks such as understanding keyboard input, transmitting data to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the storage drives, and managing peripheral devices such as printers. Without an operating system the user cannot use any computer or mobile device. The operating system has even greater responsibilities and powers with respect to large systems. It's like a traffic cop â€” it makes sure there's no conflict between various systems and users running at the same time. Often responsible for protection is the operating system, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the device.</p></div>
